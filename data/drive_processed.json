The company had undergone rapid expansion over the previous decade but remained a lagger in the digital marketing space.  There was strong alignment between Analytics and Marketing due to my shared leadership of both teams, but many members of other teams were risk-averse on expanding into digital.\n\n---\n\n## Slide 5\n\nOverall goals of our tactics: Improve ROAS, reallocate budget into areas with more room to scale\n\n---\n\n## Slide 6\n\nMarketing history of the company\n\nEvolution of measurement decisions\n\n---\n\n## Slide 7\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n---\n\n## Slide 8\n\nProspecting: Display and social channels need reads longitudinally across campaign, audience and ad group levels.\n\nCatalog: Need for improved and more frequent match-back incrementality for multiple unique segments and co-op audiences\n\nRetargeting: Similar need for metrics on incrementality of each platform to adjust budget and find the right combination of vendors.\n\n---\n\n## Slide 9\n\nDecember\n\nFebruary\n\nMarch\n\nMay\n\nKick-off:  Critical step was getting the right people in the room \u2013 initial alignment on what would be considered\n\nData import and hygiene \u2013 I needed this step to take utmost precedence since multiple channels and systems involved\n\nSet up of initial tests \u2013 Choice of first tests was important, as we needed a win to gain trust\n\nFirst read out \u2013 We needed to explain the statistical rigor of the test approachably to executives\n\n---\n\n## Slide 10\n\n---\n\n## Slide 11\n\n---\n\n## Slide 12\n\nAlignment: Executive trust was built through showing both successes and failures, consistent metrics, and a willingness to prove tactics before scaling\n\nAnalytics: It\u2019s rare to have marketing and analytics deeply entwined, so cultivate those relationships early and often for a united front when making sweeping changes\n\nTesting:  Starting with one channel first allowed us to create a value framework to triage where we needed the most immediate attention\n\n---\n\n"

No investment in brand building/ strategy. \nContext:\nBrand went through significant turmoil in the last years with all stores being closed in 2020 and going through chapter 11. \nBrand is struggling with very high return rates\n\n---\n\n## Slide 5\n\nBackground: Performance Max - One Size Fits All?\n\n\u00a9\n\nPerformance Max is an automated goal-based campaign type that uses machine learning to serve audiences the most relevant creative, combined with the with the best bid to maximize campaign performance.\n\nThe key element of Pmx is automation\n\nGoogle automates the creation of ads with assets provided by the advertiser\n\nPmax promise is to serve the best performing creative assets to maximize performance\n\n---\n\n## Slide 6\n\nGeo Test\nRead 1\n\nPerformance Max - One Size Fits All?

All tests came back with very low incrementality, depending on the brand and time of testing between 12% and 26%.\n\nMarket Insight\n\n---\n\n## Slide 7\n\nAnswer: Since these ranges are significantly lower than all other channels and tactics in the portfolio, the brand felt the urgent need to find alternative investment areas.\n\nAnalyzing the Results\n\nReasoning: Low ROAS (Return on Advertising Spend) means that for every dollar spent on advertising, the revenue generated is relatively low, indicating an inefficient or unprofitable marketing campaign.\n\nQuestion: Given low incrementality, should PMAX investment continue to be made?\n\n---\n\n## Slide 8\n\nLast Click ROAS vs. Incremental ROAS\n\n\u00a9\n\nScale\n\n3.09\n\nPlatform ROAS\n\nGeo Test ROAS\n\n0.6\n\nPMAX\n\n7.97\n\nGeo Test ROAS\n\n3.83\n\nMeta\n\n19.77\n\nPlatform ROAS\n\nGeo Test ROAS\n\n5.5\n\nDisplay\n\nGoal ROAS\u000b 4\n\nPortfolio\n\nInc ROAS\n\n3.98\n\nPlatform ROAS\n\nOverall brand performance at the same time\nBase Attribution\nROAS: 7.74\nCPO: $25.86\nAdvanced Attribution\niROAS: 3.89\niCPO: $47.56\n\nInsight\n\nMultiplier: 20%\n\nMultiplier: 48%\n\nMultiplier: 28%\n\n---\n\n## Slide 9\n\nTakeaways\n\nWhereas last click data looked promising for the Pmax investment, the brand struggled overall with low ROAS and high CPOs. In an incrementality view, Pmax is to this day the only channel that lost significantly when compared to a last click view. \n\nUnder these circumstances, the brand could not operate efficiently. They needed to find alternative channels and tactics to invest in.\n\nSince it was not possible anymore to switch back to smart shopping, it was decided to  restart legacy tactic standard shopping. That decision should change the trajectory for the business completely.\n\n---\n\n## Slide 10\n\nDiversified Portfolio Leaning Heavily into Shopping and Social\n\n\u00a9\n\nWith \u201cShopping\u201d (Smart Shopping, Pmax) covering 32% of the performance marketing investment in Q2/ Q3 2022, the brand is in urgent need of alternatives if Pmax is not performing as expected.\n\nThe brand decided to test Google\u2019s legacy advertising product: Standard Shopping as an alternative to Pmax which had been heavily invested in\n\n---\n\n## Slide 11\n\nTest Design: Replace PMAX with Standard Shopping\n\n\u00a9\n\nNew Jersey\nConnecticut\nNew York\nFlorida\nTexas \nIllinois \nCalifornia\n\nAnchor Markets (BAU)\n\nMedia Spend\n\n~70% of \u000bTotal Revenue\n\nOregon\nOhio\nVirginia \nNorth Carolina\n\nTest Markets\n\nGoogle PMAX\n\nRevenue\n\nPaid Social\n\nPaid Search\n\nDisplay\n\nAffiliate\n\nMedia Spend\n\n~5% of \u000bTotal Revenue\n\nGoogle PMAX\n\nRevenue\n\nGoogle Standard Shopping\n\n32%\n\n34%\n\n13%\n\n14%\n\n7%\n\n32%\n\n32%\n\nReplacing Google PMAX \nwith Google Standard Shopping\n\nIs Google Shopping going to do better or worse than PMAX?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n---\n\n## Slide 12\n\nTest Results: Google Shopping results came in strong\n\n\u00a9\n\nNew Jersey\nConnecticut\nNew York\nFlorida\nTexas \nIllinois \nCalifornia\n\nAnchor Markets (BAU)\n\nMedia Spend\n\n~70% of \u000bTotal Revenue\n\nOregon\nOhio\nVirginia \nNorth Carolina\n\nTest Markets\n\nGoogle PMAX\n\nRevenue\n\nPaid Social\n\nPaid Search\n\nDisplay\n\nAffiliate\n\nMedia Spend\n\n~5% of \u000bTotal Revenue\n\nGoogle PMAX\n\nRevenue\n\nGoogle Standard Shopping\n\n32%\n\n34%\n\n13%\n\n14%\n\n7%\n\n32%\n\n32%\n\nReplacing Google PMAX \nwith Google Standard Shopping\n\nThe test results came back with 94% incrementality, significantly higher than smart shopping (~60%), and what was expected internally, opening now the opportunity for continuous investment in Shopping tactics.\n\u000bPmax is paused and will be continuously evaluated as new features are added.\n\nMarket Insights\n\n35% lift\n\n---\n\n## Slide 13\n\nBefore and After Results are a Game Changer\n\n\u00a9\n\nThe client is a classic retailer, with very strong Q3 and Q4 performance. After making the changes to the marketing portfolio, performance skyrocketed, and the brand was able to spend even more during the quieter season, and increased revenue significantly, with improving efficiency at the same time. Revenue dropped only by 3.5% from Q4 2022 to Q1 2023 in the height of the recession!\n\nMedia Spend\n\n+296k\n\n+17%\n\nRevenue\n\n+9M\n\n+65%\n\nROAS\n\n+3.19\n\n+41%\n\nOrders\n\n+23k\n\n+34%\n\niCPO\n\n-13%\n\niROAS\n\n+166%\n\n---\n\n## Slide 14\n\nBrand beats traditional seasonality patterns after committing to incrementality\n\n\u00a9\n\nDespite very challenging external factors like the current recession, inventory challenges, and change in customers spending patterns, the brand grew further in 2023. \n\nThe only change made at the end of 2022/ beginning of 2023 was following solely the results from incrementality tests and execute accordingly. \n\nGoogle Shopping drove 35% of all incremental orders in Q1/ 2023.\n\n---\n\n## Slide 15\n\nA Few Aspects to Keep in Mind\n\n\u00a9\n\nPmax has great potential. To reach the customer at the right time, on the right platform (YouTube, Search, Display), with the right creative is a realistic promise. \n\nRather sooner than later Google will provide enhancements to the product that makes it significantly better and very interesting for performance advertisers. It is important to keep an open dialogue and test regularly.\n\n---\n\n"

There is still room to optimize that budget so that it could potentially perform better over time, which could lead to a Fund decision.\nPotential Optimizations:\nRefine keyword list\nYou can use a variety of free tools to identify best and poor performing keywords (Google: https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7337243) \n\nSet maximum CPC target\n\n---\n\n## Slide 13\n\nFinal Thoughts - Success Starts at the Beginning\n\nFor best results, planning to measure advanced attribution should start before a campaign is set-up\n\nThink about and plan for:\n\n---\n\n## Slide 14\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nFor the data scientist and other attribution practitioners, it is helpful to remember that the results of the tests that you worked to design/interpret could lead to a significant restructuring of a brand\u2019s marketing plan\n\nFor the brand marketer who will need to make budget decisions after receiving test results, it helps to make a decision matrix ahead of running tests to counterbalance emotions that arise from seeing unexpected/ disappointing results\n\nFor the media buyers and agency teams, remember that optimization best practices within each platform are the same whether using last-touch or advanced attribution, you\u2019re simply looking to a new North Star\n\n---\n\n"

One of my primary challenges is, a lot of my revenue seems to come from organic sources. Which makes sense, we have a lot of brand love, our customers post and share about the brand just like that. But how do I grow the brand if all my sales are really driven by organic sources?\n\nHmmm\u2026 wonder how much of her business is New vs Returning customers. If it's such a beloved brand, she must have strong retention rates, and a good chunk of her revenue must be returning customers\n\nStep 1: \u000bConversion Types: New vs Returning analyses\nStep 2: \u000bMMMs for each convtype for understanding contribution of media vs organic sources\n\nSolution Architecture\n\nTranslating Business Questions to Analytical Problem Statements\n\n---\n\n## Slide 10\n\nTranslating Business Questions to Analytical Problem Statements\n\nIt\u2019s so overwhelming to understand whether Facebook is driving real growth for the brand. My Google analytics reports a Facebook ROAS of 0.5 and Facebook itself reports 2.5. It\u2019s so challenging to navigate these numbers to manage spend, let alone explain it to my CFO.\n\nThis is very typical situation for most marketers. She needs clean multipliers.\n\nStep 3: \u000bTriangulation Analysis and Multipliers\n\nSolution Architecture\n\n---\n\n## Slide 11\n\nTranslating Business Questions to Analytical Problem Statements\n\nOur board is constantly asking us for our LTV:CAC ratio, and we get lost chasing data issues. We are trying to understand our true unit economics so we can drive profitable growth, but navigating the data is a challenge.\n\nThere are probably some data hygiene things to work through. But we need to overlay LTVs to get to unit economics.\n\nStep 4: \u000bLTV Analysis\nStep 5:\nFlywheel analysis: Overlay other costs and get to unit economics\n\nSolution Architecture\n\n---\n\n## Slide 12\n\nTranslating Business Questions to Analytical Problem Statements\n\n\u2026and then there we have two very different customers, the training customer and the surf customer, it's not easy to get to. The definitions are pretty nuances, but it's there, and we theorize that it could have a real implication to our unit economics.\n\nHmmm\u2026 wonder how different the retention rates and LTVs are for those two segments.\n\nStep 5: \u000bBreaking down LTV by customer segment \nStep 6+:\nMMMs by Customer Segment, Triangulation Analysis, Multipliers\n\nSolution Architecture\n\n---\n\n## Slide 13\n\nSolution Strategy: Marketing Accounting Framework => Conversion Types\n\n---\n\n## Slide 14\n\nConversion Types: Breaking down the business into its constituent parts\n\nAs part of solution strategy, we apply Marketing Accounting Framework principles to break down the business into its meaningfully constituent parts\n\nRoughly half the revenue is from New customers and half is from Returning customers.\n\nWe are expecting to see media have more impact in driving New customers and less impact on Returning customers\n\nAssumption\n\nNew vs Returning Customer Revenue\n\n---\n\n## Slide 15\n\nSolution Strategy: Role of MMMs\n\n---\n\n## Slide 16\n\nSolution Strategy: Building MMMs to decompose credit to various business drivers\n\nMarketing \nMix Model\n\nMedia & Promo\nVariables\n\nTrend\n\nHoliday\n\nSeason\n\nEconometric\nVariables\n\nDependent variable\n\nIndependent variables\n\nNew Customer Orders\n\nReturning Customer Orders\n\nMarketing \nMix Model\n\nOrders(t-1)\n\nOrders(t-2)\n\nOrders(t-n)\n\nAutoregressive\nVariables\n\nSales outcomes in\nprior time periods\n\nWe are using MMMs to understand the contribution of underlying business drivers (that are modeled as input variables) to New and Returning customer orders (that are modeled as output variables).\n\nProcess\n\n---\n\n## Slide 17\n\nInterpretation: MMMs report card the drivers behind New Customer Acquisition\n\nAbout 40% is driven by media and promos/discounts\n\nAbout 40% of new customer acquisition is Base\n\nAbout 20% is momentum\n\n---\n\n## Slide 18\n\nInterpretation: MMMs report card the drivers behind Returning Customer Orders\n\nA good 40% of returning revenue is being driven by media meant for new customer acquisition\n\u000b~20% is discounts; customers are responding strongly to promo\n\nAbout 40% of the business is baseline\n\nSeasonality has a negative impact indicating some need for unpacking\n\n---\n\n## Slide 19\n\nSolution Strategy: Role of MMMs\n\n---\n\n## Slide 20\n\nInterpretation: MMMs decomposition to Multipliers and Channel ROIs\n\n---\n\n## Slide 21\n\nThe Next Problem Statement\n\nWell, how does that all that translate to unit economics for the business? We are not an early venture backed grow-at-all-costs business. We are a bottom-line-conscious-return-strong-EBIT-to get-everyone-paid type of business. How does this translate to LTV:CAC ratio?\n\n---\n\n## Slide 22\n\nSolution Strategy: Overlay LTV\n\n---\n\n## Slide 23\n\nSolution Strategy: Removing noise in LTV reporting\n\nResellers who buy locally and resell in Asia add noise and skew to LTV estimates\n\n---\n\n## Slide 24\n\nRetention rates are strong, and LTV is stable YoY\n\nWith all the reseller noise, we couldn't be sure about our LTV, but this LTV cut now finally gives us crisp understanding of longitudinal customer behaviors. We now understand our LTV and customer maturity much better\n\nOver 24 months, about 35% of customers come back. Average LTV is around $150, and is pretty stable for the last 2-3 years\n\n---\n\n## Slide 25\n\nLTV/CAC is strong\n\nLTV/aaCAC \n4.6\n\nFinally, I am able to get a credible LTV:CAC ratio to report back to the board. Hopefully, we can buy the operating team some room to execute with this strong read.\n\nLTV  = $150 \naaCAC  =   $32\n\n---\n\n## Slide 26\n\nSolution Strategy: Cost accounting to get to unit economics\n\n---\n\n## Slide 27\n\nPutting it all together to get to the Unit Economics of the business\n\nHaving these big picture KPIs, gave me the conviction to step away from data that was bogging me down. Now I can make decisions in a timely manner with confidence and clarity.\n\nJolyn makes $37 in contribution margin with the first order. Usually, this number is negative for many emerging brands.\n\nAnd the brand makes $63 over the next 24 months, in all making it $100 in contribution per customer.\n\nWith these unit economics, now the board will want to see us invest aggressively into growth. So, Jen just needs to give me a number!\n\n---\n\n## Slide 28\n\nWell wait, where am going to find that kind of growth. I am already a beloved brand among folks who are training, how much growth is there to be had?\n\nNew Problem Statement\n\n---\n\n## Slide 29\n\nSolution Strategy: Starting the next Advanced Attribution evolution\n\n---\n\n## Slide 30\n\nUnpacking LTV by customer segments\n\nFor families who have kids in swim training, we probably are very well penetrated. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we have some 30-40% of TAM in the training segment. Surf is the big opportunity for us, but it\u2019s a different GTM entirely, it's more seasonal, weaker unit economics. My challenge now is to shape an efficient GTM for the surf segment\n\nTraining is almost 85% of the business, Surf is a smaller 15%\n\n---\n\n## Slide 31\n\nYou\u2019ll learn something in each step that\u2019ll shape the next steps you take\n\nAdvanced Attribution is a \nJourney\n\n---\n\n"

Conversely, existing patients represent 63% of completed appointments but only 57% of production.\nAverage production value of new patient service is $731 vs. an average of about $550 for existing patients.\n\n37%\n\n43%\n\n63%\n\n57%\n\nProduction\n\nAppointments\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n50,000\n\n100,000\n\n150,000\n\n200,000\n\n250,000\n\n$40,000,000\n\n$80,000,000\n\n$120,000,000\n\n0\n\n0\n\n---\n\n## Slide 13\n\nAverage service value: new patients by channel\n\nThere isn\u2019t significant distinction in new patient average service value among marketing channels - with the exception of Direct Mail which has an average service value almost $70 higher than the average of all other channels. This makes sense based on how you can target the right offer and service to the right audience as part of a sound segmentation and list selection process.\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n---\n\n## Slide 14\n\n\u00a9\n\nDetailed Learnings\u000bMMM Decompositions\n\n---\n\n## Slide 15\n\nMedia drives both new patient and existing patient appointment booking.\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n---\n\n## Slide 16\n\nMMM result summary - new patient appointments booked\n\nInsights:\n\nWhile only 5% of spend, Direct Mail had the 3rd highest incremental contribution % (0.7%) and the lowest CPA ($210) by a significant margin.\nSearch: Non-brand has 2x the incremental contribution of any channel but still at a very high CPA of $731. Brand search has the lowest incremental contribution of any marketing channel and the highest CPA indicating it is not capturing new patient demand.\n\nMedia drives around 4.2% of new patient appointment bookings.\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n---\n\n## Slide 17\n\nMMM result summary - existing patient appointments booked\n\nInsight:\n\nDifferent from new patients,  Brand search has the 3rd highest spend % and 3rd highest contribution % but the 2nd lowest CPA indicating existing patients use brand search \u201cnavigationally\u201d to find JDC to schedule. Lower CPA attributable to lower CPC for brand terms.\nAlso, unlike with new patients, Direct Mail seems to be less effective at driving repeat booking - though spend levels are low it has the highest CPA at $140.\n\nMedia drives around 5.6% of existing patient appointment bookings.\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n---\n\n## Slide 18\n\nMMM result summary - new patient appointments completed\n\nInsight:\n\nBrand search has the 2nd lowest  contribution at 0.7% and the highest CPA further evidencing that it does not drive incremental new patient appointment completes. Unlike with new patients, Direct Mail seems to be less effective at driving repeat booking - though spend levels are low it has the highest CPA at $140.\n\nMedia drives around 5.3% of existing patient completed appointments.\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n---\n\n## Slide 19\n\nMMM result summary - existing patient appointments completed\n\nInsight:\n\nNon-brand search represents over half spend but only 28% of incremental contribution.\n\nMedia drives around 4.1% of existing patient completed appointments.\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n---\n\n## Slide 20\n\nGA and ad platform tracking overstate digital media contribution to appointments booked.\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n---\n\n## Slide 21\n\nNew patient booked ROAS: GA vs. MMM attribution\n\nGA attribution over credits all channels with the largest variance in Brand Search. This is not uncommon as brand search tends to be one of the least incremental channels.\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n---\n\n## Slide 22\n\nNew patient booked ROAS: ad platform vs. GA vs. MMM attribution\n\nAd platform attribution (google ads) overstates ROAS even more severely than GA attribution for new patient booking.\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n---\n\n## Slide 23\n\nBlended booked ROAS: GA vs. MMM attribution\n\nLooking at blended (new and existing patient) ROAS closes the gap slightly to non-incremental GA attributed ROAS.\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n---\n\n## Slide 24\n\nNew patient vs. blended MMM attributed ROAS\n\nWhen considering the incremental contribution to existing patient appointment bookings along with new patient bookings we see 3x improvement to ROAS vs. looking at new patient bookings alone.\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n---\n\n## Slide 25\n\n\u00a9\n\nLearnings\u000b\u201cNow What\u201d: Next Steps\n\n---\n\n## Slide 26\n\nProject Objectives / Success Criteria\n\n1\n\nProduce  accurate media contribution insights\n\n\u201cWe are having a hard time understanding the true unit economics of the media spend\".\n\n2\n\nProvide framework to evaluate and enable new agency partner\n\n\"We are about to onboard a new agency, it would be great to have new insights around media's efficiency driving the business, so we can get oriented on go to market strategy for the brand\u201d.\n\n3\n\nAssess  Marketing\u2019s role in driving leads/lead quality\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of indirection from leads to booked appointments to actual cash collection, its very hard to understand which leads are turning into $s, and the role of marketing in driving higher quality leads\u201d.\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n---\n\n## Slide 27\n\nReadout Artifacts\n\nAppt.

At the taxonomy granularity level above, the spend and estimated contribution thins out significantly, we may not get MMM to pick up the effect of these investments.\n\nWe have to aggregate these channels to something large enough to expect MMMs to pick up.\n\nAt this level of taxonomy grain, the spends and expected contribution is very sparse\n\nNotes\n\nMedia Platforms\n\nRappi Internal Attribution assigned contribution\n\n---\n\n## Slide 12\n\nRappi MMM Structure - Media Taxonomy\n\nTry the first run at \nChannel + Partner + Audience grain.

But I quickly realized that while the brand had tremendous potential, there were significant hurdles to overcome:\nFragmented Tech Stack:\nWe had multiple tools and platforms that didn\u2019t talk to each other, creating silos and inefficiencies\nPoor Data Quality:\nInconsistent data collection across locations made it hard to trust the numbers.\nMisaligned Attribution:\nWe were relying on last-click attribution, which undervalued our upper- and mid-funnel efforts like social media and overemphasized bottom-funnel channels like search\n\n---\n\n## Slide 4\n\nWhy We Focused on Tech Stack Audits and Advanced Measurement\n\nTime and Resource Constraints:\nGiven our limited time today, I had to narrow our focus. While customer experience, site layout, brand/creative, and in-location operations are all essential components of a successful strategy, I\u2019ve learned that without a strong tech and data foundation, none of those efforts can reach their full potential.\nThe Need for Scalability:\nWith multiple locations and ambitious growth goals, we required a tech ecosystem that could seamlessly grow alongside our business\nThe Desire for Data-Driven Decisions:\nMoving beyond gut instincts to build a culture rooted in actionable insights and informed decision-making\n\n---\n\n## Slide 5\n\nPart 1: Auditing the Tech Stack and Data Quality\n\n---\n\n## Slide 6\n\nThe State of Our Tech Stack When I Joined\n\nInventory of Tools:\nWe had a CRM, a POS system, email marketing tools, social media platforms, and web analytics\u2014but they weren\u2019t all integrated.\nData Collection Challenges:\nData was scattered across systems, and there was no single source of truth.\nData Quality Issues:\nIncomplete, inconsistent, and outdated data made it hard to trust our metrics.\n\n---\n\n## Slide 7\n\nOur Tech Stack Audit Checklist\n\nInventory of Tools and Platforms:\nWe cataloged every tool and identified overlaps and gaps\nData Collection and Storage:\nWe centralized data in a cloud-based data warehouse\nData Quality Assessment:\nWe cleaned up our data, ensuring accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness\nIntegration and Automation:\nWe used APIs and middleware to connect our systems and automate workflows\nScalability:\nWe chose tools that could grow with us, adding new locations and channels without breaking the system\nUser Adoption and Training:\nWe trained our teams to use the tools effectively and established feedback loops for continuous improvement\n\n---\n\n## Slide 8\n\nBest Practices We Learned\n\n---\n\n## Slide 9\n\nPart 2: Advanced Measurement Techniques\n\n---\n\n## Slide 10\n\nThe Problem with Last-Click Attribution\n\nWhen I joined, we were heavily reliant on last-click attribution (and still are to a certain extent). This meant:\nOvervaluing Search: Bottom-funnel channels like search got all the credit.\nUndervaluing Social Media: Upper- and mid-funnel efforts like social media and display ads were seen as \u201cnice to have\u201d but not essential.\nMisaligned Budgets: We were pouring money into channels that captured demand but weren\u2019t driving incremental growth.\n\n---\n\n## Slide 11\n\nHow We Implemented Triangulation Analysis\n\nTriangulation Tool\n\nPlatform Reported Performance\n\nLead Form Submissions & Lead revenue\n\nFindings\n\nInsights\n\nData Collection\n\n---\n\n## Slide 12\n\nLeveraging MMM to Quantify Incremental Impact\n\nModel Development:\nWe analyzed historical data on marketing spend, sales, leads and external factors (e.g., seasonality).\nResults:\n\n---\n\n## Slide 13\n\nBest Practices We Followed\n\nCombine Data Sources: Use platform-reported, CRM, and web analytics data\nFocus on Incrementality: Understand the true impact of each channel\nIterate and Refine: Continuously update your models with new data\nCommunicate Clearly: Present insights in a way that stakeholders can understand and act on\n\n---\n\n## Slide 14\n\nPart 3: LaserAway Case Study on Advanced Measurement\n\n---\n\n## Slide 15\n\nThe Challenge: Misaligned Attribution\n\nWhen I joined LaserAway, one of the biggest challenges was understanding the true impact of our marketing efforts. We were heavily reliant on last-click attribution, which meant:\nOvervaluing Search: Bottom-funnel channels like search got all the credit\nUndervaluing Social Media, CTV and Streaming Audio: Upper- and mid-funnel efforts like social media and CTV were seen as \u201cnice to have\u201d but not essential\nMisaligned Budgets: We were pouring money into channels that captured demand but weren\u2019t driving incremental growth\n\n---\n\n## Slide 16\n\nThe Solution: Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)\n\nModel Development:\nWe analyzed historical data on marketing spend, sales, and external factors (e.g., seasonality)\nResults:\n\n---\n\n## Slide 17\n\nMMM: Reallocation by Channels, Scenario 1\n\nMedia Mix:\n\nScenario #1 keeps budget flat across highest spend channels, cuts or scales back underperformers while scaling back Bing and Streaming. \n$8.2M incremental annual CM\n\n---\n\n## Slide 18\n\nMMM: Reallocation by Channels, Scenario 2\n\nScenario #2 layers on higher investment levels in Bing and Streaming based on scale potential. \n$10M incremental annual spend would result in $22.4M incremental annual CM.\n\nMedia Mix:\n\n---\n\n## Slide 19\n\nThe Impact of Our Changes\n\nImproved Efficiency:\nOur integrated tech stack and clean data saved time and reduced errors.\nBetter Budget Allocation:\nBy understanding the incremental impact of each channel, we can optimize our spend.\nIncreased Conversions:\nOur reallocated budget should drive an incremental revenue of X\n\n---\n\n## Slide 20\n\nConclusion: My Call to Action\n\nRecap Key Points\nAs CMO of LaserAway, I faced challenges with a fragmented tech stack, poor data quality, and misaligned attribution\nBy focusing on tech stack audits and advanced measurement, we built a strong foundation and optimized our marketing spend\nExpected results: improved efficiency, better budget allocation, and increased conversions\n\n\nYour Next Steps\nAudit Your Tech Stack:\nIdentify gaps and inefficiencies in your current setup\nInvest in Advanced Measurement:\nUse triangulation and MMM to uncover the true impact of your marketing efforts\nDrive Incremental Growth:\nAllocate budget based on incremental impact, not just direct conversions\n\n---\n\n## Slide 21\n\nQ & A\n\n---\n\n"

Indicating people are loading the site on the browser directly without necessarily using Google search to navigate\n\n---\n\n## Slide 45\n\nMTA has some vestiges to be aware of\n\nImpression pixels, Companion pixels\nAdserver Log files\nPlatform log files \nEg: Facebook sync and log files, Pinterest log files, Snap log files\nFacebook Advanced Analytics logs\n\nWalled garden Impression measurement through modeling\nTV measurement in MTA\n\nVestigial parts\n\nPseudoscience\n\nData reconciliation issues\nTracking breakages\n\nStubborn Issues\n\n---\n\n## Slide 46\n\nModule\nPost Purchase Surveys: Poor man\u2019s incrementality \nReal-life Case Study for Fast Growing Fashion Brand\n\n---\n\n## Slide 47\n\nBenefits of using a Post Purchase Survey (PPS)\n\n\u201cHow did you hear about us?\u201d\u000b\nWhat really matters is why someone purchased and what they remember\u000b\nA customers first touchpoint (Channel Attributed) could be something they don\u2019t even remember\n\nMarket Insight\n\n---\n\n## Slide 48\n\nUsing a PPS to compare Facebook and TikTok\n\nTo calculate implied revenue:\nDownload PPS data in an excel spreadsheet and sum up the revenue for responses of Facebook and TikTok\nI have a different response for Facebook and Instagram, so for Facebook I add those together\nNow that we have the total PPS Revenue, divide that by the response rate to get an \u201cimplied revenue\u201d\nDivide that \u201cimplied revenue\u201d by ad spend to get an \u201cimplied ROAS\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Slide 49\n\nSpecific Calculations to find Implied ROAS\n\nGiven Data:\n\nRevenue for responses:\nFacebook = $34.6k\nInstagram = $39.6k \nTikTok = $16.7k\n\nResponse rate = 41.68%\n\nFacebook Spend = $154k\n\nTikTok Spend = $37.7k\n\nFacebook Calculations:\n\nImplied Revenue =\n($34.6 + $39.6) / 0.4168 = $178k\n\nImplied ROAS = \n$178k / $154k = 1.16\n\nTikTok Calculations:\n\nImplied Revenue =\n$16.7k / 0.4168 = $40k\n\nImplied ROAS = \n$40k / $37.7k = 1.06\n\n---\n\n## Slide 50\n\nLeverage PPS Implied ROAS to create an %Multiplier\n\n% Multiplier = PPS Implied Revenue / Channel Reported Revenue\n\nThese results allow us to translate in platform ROAS to a comparable metric and vice versa\n\n---\n\n## Slide 51\n\nNormalizing ROAS Data\n\nFB AA ROAS = 1.67 x 0.69 = 1.15\n\n\nTT AA ROAS = 1.35 x 0.78 = 1.05 (rounding errors lol!)\n\n---\n\n## Slide 52\n\nActionable Scenario, weekly read\n\nBudgets - 20k/day on FB, 2k/day on TikTok\n\n---\n\n"

00\u2019s\n\nMulti-Touch Attribution\n\nIncrementality\n\nOriginally invented to serve CPG marketers, got adopted more broadly in the last 20 years.\n\nWith the advent of the internet and profilteration of websites, LastTouch attribution was born primarily out of technical convenience.\n\nWith rising Display media investment, and frequency with consumers growing, multi-touch attribution approaches came to market as an improvement over LastAd, to help justify display\u2019s role in the funnel.\n\nRise of walled gardens, consumer privacy legislation and death of cookie, leads to experimentation-based methods for media measurement.\n\nDemocratization of MMM sciences, easy access to data science talent and renewed focus on 1st party data gives rise to a flood of MMM tools and services.\n\nEarly 2020s\n\nResurgence of MMM\n\nStrengths\n\nLimitations\n\nCausal, Aggregated Insights, Explanatory Power, Long term forecasting and planning\n\nNot granular, Modeling art = Informed opinion, One size does not fit all\n\nEasy to implement, Ubiquitous availability, Real-time reporting, quick read of targeting efficiency\n\nNot Causal, Correlational, Limited to last interaction, no industry standard - industry wide differences\n\nCausal, Walled gardens measurement with 1st party data, More tactical than MMM (less than MTA)\n\nData science still complex, Channel specifics are important, One size does not fit all\n\nMarket flooded with options, becoming affordable, more MMM talent, faster refreshes, data management improvements\n\nLots of snake oil, one size still does not fit all, requires users to be discerning and use it as a decision support tool vs Source of truth\n\nNot Causal, Correlational, No impression measurement, no walled garden channels, Tracking and reconciliation hell\n\nBetter correlation, customer journey insights, granular insights, Accessible for In-house implementation\n\n---\n\n## Slide 26\n\nWhat is Marketing Mix

CTV and FB performing stronger per MMM vs. platform/UTM results   - Opportunity for increased investment   - Social, Audio, and Youtube are showing lower contribution per MMM   - Testing could help more specifically attribute performance to certain channels   - Google Search performs below the $3 ROAS goal per MMM and UTM   - Purposely managing below $3 to gain market share in certain services | - Run a geo test on CTV channels to validate lift   - Run a Facebook lift test to validate lift   -

Jan\u2019 24\n\n| Key Takeaways | Insights | Recommendations |\n|---|---|---|\n| Zip test - activating in Opportunity zips in Virginia generated impressive lift | - Opportunity zips outshone Strong zips in performance by a country mile. <br> - When we activated in the opportunity zips, the nearby zips from other states/zip labels were seeing more sales. This may be because <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - People travelled between zips for various reasons like work, college etc <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Their address was different from their temporary residence <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Nearest store was in a VA location <br> - As expected, Opportunity zips, even outside test regions were seeing elevated performance in comparison to strong zips, which further validates our underlying statistical selection methods and supports an expanded scale test | - A scaled test for zip-level activation covering 1/4th to 1/3rd of the country <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - See if we can replicate a similar effect with larger test group. |\n| - Opportunity & regular zips combined give a strong 22% to 33% lift on revenue <br> - At a ROAS range of 6-8, which will put this execution among the most efficient tactics in Laseraway\u2019s portfolio | | |\n\n[Confluence Link](#)\n\n---\n\n## Streaming Channels Scale Geo Test | Feb\u2019 24\n\n| Key Takeaways                                                                 | Insights                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Recommendations                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scaling spend in streaming channels in about half the country generated strong lead revenue lift | - We are able to measure an average lift of ~12%  - OTT (Roku, Yelp-TTD) and Audio (Pandora) streaming channels have strong lead generation under scaled spend.                                          | Change the national media mix to incorporate the results in the test cell. Rebalance portfolio spend from Search into Streaming. |\n| The Non-Brand Search scale down has been executed to have minimal impact on lead revenue | - Scale down in Non Brand Search is having minimal effects of revenue  - Non-Brand Search spend was cut by ~47%, that represented ~18.2% of total monthly spend.  - We are estimating that ~16% of attributable revenue was lost due to the cuts, which represents ~4.5% of total lead revenue |                                                                                                     |\n\n[Confluence Link](#)\n\n---\n\n## National Scale Zip level Test Design | Mar\u2019 24\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nRun a scaled test for Tiers 1 and 2 with a total budget of $420,920.\n\n| Tier | Predicted Orders Per Capita | Population | Estimated Lift | Budget   | Estimated ROAS |\n|------|-----------------------------|------------|----------------|----------|----------------|\n| 1    | > 1 and <= 25               | 1,965,419  | 37%            | $123,821 | $1.4           |\n| 2    | >0.5 to <=1                 | 4,715,856  | 38%            | $297,099 | $0.6           |\n| 3    | <=0.5                       | 15,722,889 | 67%            | $990,542 | $0.3           |\n\n[Confluence Link](#)\n\n---\n\n## Geospatial Analysis | Jun\u2019 24\n\n**Recommended Approach**\n\nUtilize regional thresholds for distance-based targeting.\n\nFor example, California with a 54-mile threshold due to extended commutes and community metrics. This approach ensures high efficiency by focusing on zip codes with more than 10 customers within the regionally adjusted boundaries.\n\n**Summary**\n\nGeographic distribution of customers is not always oriented in a consistent distance from store locations. Effective targeting combining historical zip level sales data and geospatial analysis techniques can help in optimizing advertising spend and maximizing sales potential.\n\n[Confluence Link](#)\n\n---\n\n## Go-forward plan\n\n![Graphical illustration of a chart with upward trends and a red arrow indicating progress.](#)\n\n> \u00a9 M\u00b2.club\n\n---\n\n## Go-forward Plan\n\n### Sep' 24\n\n**MMM refresh**\n\n- Rebuild the MMM model using the latest data inputs, improving its ability to adapt to market changes and trends.\n\n### Sep - Oct' 24\n\n**Triangulation analysis incorporating MMM results**\n\n- Reconcile MMM contribution estimates and Incrementality test results to extract seasonal multipliers for media channels.\n- Evaluate channel performance and provide recommendations for optimal media investment decisions.\n\n### Oct - Nov' 24\n\n**Advanced attribution dashboard for LaserAway**\n\n- Implement a triangulation based advanced attribution dashboard in LaserAway\u2019s BI environment (Domo).\n- Implement data governance and standardized taxonomy to ensure data quality and build confidence in insights.\n\n---\n\n```markdown\n## Artifacts\n\n![Graphical Elements](#)\n\n- A red graph with three axes and a dotted line indicating a curve.\n- Background with vertical lines and dots resembling a bar chart.\n\n> \u00a9 M\u00b2.club\n```\n\n---\n\n## Project Artifacts\n\n![Google Drive Screenshot](image-link)\n\n**Project Google Drive**  \n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oP5FatIlOXiB-9yOQaZTAiOY-BdPv7na?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oP5FatIlOXiB-9yOQaZTAiOY-BdPv7na?usp=drive_link)\n\n![Confluence Page Screenshot](image-link)\n\n**Confluence Page**  \n[https://msquaredclub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Laseraway/overview](https://msquaredclub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Laseraway/overview)\n\n![Slack Channel Screenshot](image-link)\n\n**LaserAway Slack channel on M^2.club**  \n[https://m2clubworkspace.slack.com/archives/C05GRERKADP](https://m2clubworkspace.slack.com/archives/C05GRERKADP)\n\n---\n\n"
