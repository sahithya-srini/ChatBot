Measurement at Insurance Co\n\n---\n\n## Slide 2\n\nMedia and Measurement at Insurance Co\n\nMarketing has a range of best in class tools and capabilities; however, several of these are underutilized\nThe ability to effectively measure and manage AmFam\u2019s digital media spend is limited by set-up of tools and sub-optimal data structure\nMeanwhile, there is an ongoing effort to align technology and data capabilities more consistently across the enterprise (E1P) and other AmFam functions (Agent Sales, Customer, etc.) and Marketing needs be prepared to integrate with enterprise and functional data, tools, and capabilities\n\nImprove data structure and tagging to get the most out of marketing data and technology (e.g., Adobe, Neilson multi-touch attribution)\nBetter leverage existing 3rd party relationships while building capabilities within Marketing/Media to more actively manage data and tools internally \nPrepare for Marketing to seamlessly integrate into larger E1P strategy and roadmap for data and technology\n\nStandup near-term program to retune media data and technology\nMake tactical adjustments to existing AmFam media data and tools\nRefine paid search structure\nMake changes to data structure and tracking within Adobe\nMake changes to data structure with Neilson on multi-touch attribution\nReview and optimize (as necessary) existing contracts and spend with third party providers \nReview internal and external Marketing/Media capabilities vs. requirements \nClarify and align roadmap for AmFam media technology data and tools to integrate into enterprise E1P roadmap\n\n---\n\n## Slide 3\n\nImproved measurement will enable Marketing to measure ~$26-50M potential in Lifetime Premium (LTP)\n\noverall_0_132523698023007410 columns_7_132526074012784913 5_1_132521820530894498 23_1_132523697184890737 8_1_132525508850470429 9_1_132526855263132519\n\nMedia capability foundational set up \u2013 tuning the foundation of media execution and measurement will enhance the ability to measure and optimize performance\n2021 planned digital marketing investment of $54M can be optimized to drive an incremental $14-21M in LTP; requires shifting to campaigns to reach strategic audience targets rather than relying too heavily on automated platform optimizations\nAdditional uplift potential in programmatic from Xaxis analysis (data received 12/16)\nOptimize dot com experience to drive incremental $2-12M in LTP through 1-5% conversion rate uplift; roadmap to be determined on balance of quick wins versus long-term ambitions \nAdditional investment of $8-11M in digital investment can drive an additional $10-17M in LTP; decreases dependency on aggregators allows AmFam to own the conversation with prospects at the conversion stage of their journey\nFull LTP potential assumes optimizations have occurred against current spend and dot com lift (steps 1 and 2)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nNote: Digital consideration/acquisition budget + social awareness & digital awareness budgets (excludes OLV, will be updating upon receiving

columns_1_132548388326980915\n\nWhat is/isn\u2019t working in current state\nWhat roadblocks exist to get things to optimal performance\nWhat requirements are needed within the technologies\nHow are the technologies currently being utilized\n\nHow are the technologies currently configured\nAre there any integrations that passes data to other systems\nDo the technologies provide the ability to optimize advertising spend\nAre there governance processes in place to ensure data quality\n\nCan teams across AmFam and Mindshare get the information they need with ease\nHow well utilized are the technologies currently\nHow difficult is it to make modifications to the technologies\nAre there other technologies that are better suited\n\n---\n\n## Slide 7\n\nCurrent state assessment of key enablers from digital diagnostic\n\noverall_0_132527213503697820 columns_5_132527245448912266 4_1_132518349074456364 9_0_132527213398693272 11_1_132527140322334046 11_1_132527141759963131 13_1_132527245523046515\n\nCurrently does not allow for granular traffic breakdowns for optimizations by targeting (keyword, ad set, line item) or creative (format, theme)\nTracking codes are not in an interpretable format in Adobe (ex:DFA:4184610:265715778:463760155:0), resulting in an inefficient process for analyzing website traffic data\nCreates extra, manual steps in process \nAs a result, media measurement is occurring in ad platforms which have different definitions of \u201clead\u201d and leads to double-counting leads\n\nSource: Adobe Sales Order\n\nCurrent website tracking pixels routed through IT, resulting in long lead times\nBottleneck in process is resulting in several activations unable to be optimized in a timely manner (sometimes up to 5 months) or at all\n\nUnable to serve as single source of truth for de-duplicated conversions due to errors in data capture (>45% un-attributed quotes)\n\n---\n\n## Slide 8\n\nAdobe Launch overall is well managed with a governance process in place\n\noverall_1_132548757229074223 columns_2_132548757229074223 8_1_132548757229074223 10_1_132552095820730614 11_1_132552406999482145 14_1_132552450908761649\n\nThe need to go through security to approve new vendor pixel requests can cause a bottle neck\nPotentially still firing legacy pixels, examples:\n3 Facebook accounts currently collect data in various areas of the site\n2 DoubleClick accounts\nPixels may not be firing where expected, likely to due to unclear requirements, examples:\nDoubleClick conversion tag firing on an All Pages rule\nGoogle AdWords lead conversion tag not firing on all lead conversions\nThere is not an internal web analyst who ensures pixels are firing as expected, identify data anomalies and/or gaps in tracking in ad platforms and Adobe Analytics\n\nAllow owner of Adobe Launch the ability to run necessary tests to ensure new vendor pixel meets standards \nContinue to run quarterly QA audits but start to identify areas where there may seem to be redundancies to ensure legacy pixels are removed\nAlign on conversion definitions between AmFam and vendors before requesting a pixel be placed\nCreate reports that assess data from each platform and are compared on a regular cadence to ensure capture is as expected\n\n---\n\n## Slide 9\n\nCurrent campaign tracking taxonomy makes it difficult for teams to report and optimize marketing efforts\n\noverall_1_132548770886731299 columns_2_132548772235730475 8_1_132548772412719257 11_1_132548772412789798 4_1_132550135149987478 5_1_132550137608123686\n\nCannot easily decipher campaign information with current taxonomy, requires each team to generate a key to tie information being collected\nResults in an inability to analyze campaign performance outside of these teams\nA taxonomy has not been standardized across marketing\nSocial (paid and organic) teams have more structure\nSitecore requirement of sc_campaign parameter requires teams request an LP with parameter prior to launching a campaign, currently this is not consistently happening\nTracking parameter is not universal to systems outside of Adobe Analytics\nThe use of sourceid is customized for AmFam\u2019s Adobe Analytics but not standard to many web analytics platforms\n\nCreate an AmFam accepted taxonomy that does not require a key\nIdentify key marketing contacts within AmFam and agencies, train and ensure they are following the new taxonomy structure\nUse reports to identify when structure is not being appropriately followed\nMigrate to the use of a taxonomy that can be recognized by Adobe as well as other systems\nUTMs are more universally accepted tracking parameters that can be collected in Adobe\u2019s s.campaign configuration allowing future flexibility\n\n---\n\n## Slide 10\n\nAdobe Analytics is not configured in a way that allows marketers the ability to report at a desired granularity\n\noverall_1_132548757182960349 columns_2_132548757182960349 5_1_132548757182960349

set to DFAID or query parameter src\nBrand Muscle looks for either sourceid or origin query parameters but sets the channel\u2019s value to sourceid only\nChannel values do not provide detail about a channel that allows for it to be further broken down to further classifications\nThere are classifications with obscure naming or no value\nCampaign vs. Campaigns\nKW \u2013 KW vs. KW\nEvents such as Lead are not tracked as an aggregate requiring the need to create a custom metric\nAs Adobe becomes the source of truth in the future, not allowing users to create segments/metrics they need on their own may result in a bottle neck\n\nUpdate marketing channel processing rules to utilize new taxonomy\nSet channel values to be consistent and utilize classification rule builder to create breakdown channel value dimensions\nAudit current classifications and deprecate any that are no longer in use and rename those that are active and not clearly named\nEither create an event that tracks Lead (recommended) or create a calculated metric and share with all users\nConsider updating permissions allowing users to create segments in their view and training them on how to do so\n\n---\n\n## Slide 11\n\nNielsen MTA\u2019s marketing channels do not align with Adobe Analytics making it difficult to compare and QA\n\noverall_1_132548757213864835 columns_2_132548757213864835 5_1_132548757213864835

Email\nOther Campaign (catchall)\nBrand Muscle\nOwned Social Media\nAgent Google Local\nQR Codes\nOnline Binds are currently not being tracked\nThere undergoing work to track online binds\n~40% of online quotes and leads are unattributed\nCan be due to data unavailability tied to cookie/MAID blocking or an inability to capture ad exposure\n\nSet up marketing channels in Adobe and MTA to be the same, this will ensure that each platform provides appropriate data for marketing needs\nContinue to push forward on capturing online binds\nWork with Nielsen to find solutions to bring down the unattributed\nPossibly setting 1st party cookies to identify traffic to the site\n\n---\n\n## Slide 12\n\nAgenda\n\noverall_1_131637855834889603 columns_3_131637855929897340\n\nAudit\nAdobe

For example Retail Co 1 currently doesn\u2019t allow negatives forcing us to use exact-match keyword in keyword campaigns and bid down Auto campaigns due to the high cost of Brand search in Auto campaigns.  Therefore, the recommendations as are: \nRetail Co 1 \u2013 shows max 2 advertised products max per search-results-page (SERP)\n2-7 products per product-category (campaign cluster)\nIdeally one product per campaign\nBid Keyword campaigns to their calculated target 2.5 ROAS goal\nBid down Auto campaigns until Brand terms consume no more than 10% of overall budget\nAmazon \u2013 shows max 5 advertised products per SERP\n5-10 products per product-category (campaign cluster)\n1 product per campaign \nUse Auto and Keyword campaigns in a 1:1 mirrored structure\nBid both Auto and Keyword campaigns to the same ROAS goal\nUse Brand negatives extensively in NonBrand campaigns.\nRetail Co 2 (Criteo) \u2013 unknown max advertised product per SERP (5?)\n Use 5-10 products per product-category (campaign cluster)\nUse Brand negatives extensively in NonBrand campaigns.\nBid Keyword campaigns to their calculated target 2.5 ROAS goal\n\n5\n\n5a\n\n5b\n\n5c\n\n---\n\n## Slide 46\n\n---\n\n"

Instead of grouping items per margin, one could group items per any other business metric (e.g. inventory levels, aging, \u2026)\nCampaign structure limitations\nCampaigns must be big enough to apply these optimizations (i.e. have large number of impressions)\nIt is possible to merge small and similar campaigns in a larger one in order to apply the methodology\nOne ad group can\u2019t have more than 20k SKUs due to a google limitation\nGeographical pilots makes roll out much easier\n When results are solid, only thing required is activate new states in the pilot and negativate the same one at the control until all states are operating in the pilot version \nTip:  If all prices will change drastically in a short period of time (e.g. Black Friday), ROAS of all ad groups should be set the same value\n\n---\n\n## Slide 15\n\nAgenda\n\noverall_1_132228633324477500 columns_1_132228633324477500\n\n---\n\n## Slide 16\n\nGoogle tries to show the most relevant results and ads to each search

Team need to be close to the operation to ensure that everything is in place. For example:\nThe URLs of the restructured campaign, given the way they were created, were not able to direct people to the app, only to the website (problem was noticed because of a high rejection rate in pilot\u2019s campaigns)\nWhen creating DSA campaigns, webpage with the word \u201cunavailable\u201d were initially left out; after a website change, the word unavailable appeared in all pages when one specific show size was not available, limiting greatly the DSAs reach (problem was noticed when impressions decreased sharply)\nWhen preparing for geographical pilots, best practice is to initially duplicate the campaigns for a specific geography and leave both the original and the copied campaign running for ~1 week \u2013 this speeds up learning and minimizes revenue loss. Only then one excludes the pilot region from the original campaign\nGeographical pilots makes roll out much easier\nWhen results are robust, roll-out can be made including geographical regions on the campaign originally used for the pilot, and excluding them from the original campaigns (this minimizes revenue loss and speeds up learnings from the algorithm)\n\n---\n\n## Slide 30\n\nAgenda\n\noverall_1_132228633324477500 columns_1_132228633324477500\n\n---\n\n## Slide 31\n\nMarketers can advertise on Facebook in 4 main ways\n\noverall_0_132195188378980279 columns_4_132160486062074227 7_1_132160486135698005 10_1_132160486135962213 13_1_132160486136197031 16_1_132160486136517822 64_1_132160489039073690 68_1_132160489068626130 72_1_132160489093431606 80_1_132160489121383458 81_1_132160511556090965 82_1_132160511556370219 83_1_132160511556579659 84_1_132160511556749206 18_1_132161794657601888\n\nPay Facebook to show ads to specific audiences\nAllows advanced audience selection and placement options\n\nPay Facebook to promote a post to specific audiences\nAllows only basic audience selection\nMay or may not be published on brand\u2019s page\nUnpublished sponsored posts are usually called dark posts\n\nPay people with many social media followers to post about something\nLesser control of creative and audience\nMay be purchased directly from influencer ot through intermediaries (influencer networks)\nE.g.

question\n\nAction standards\n\nProduct 2 can gain incremental sales by allocating search spend exclusively against Product 2 SKUs, while Product 1 maintains sales without search spend due to organic relevance.\n\nTest Hypothesis\n\nIf Product 1 Walmart total ecommerce sales decrease by >20% from baseline over a 3-day period (~$XXXK) then:\nPause test, revert to previous SKU mix / bidding and re-assess\nIf our hypothesis is proven and we can increase sales with a heavier Product 2 SKU mix, then:\nWe will revert to spending only against PR or implement PR SKUs into all campaigns \nTest increasing spend on the new mix as a subsequent test (i.e. larger scale)\nIf the hypothesis was disproven, then we will:\nRetest (potentially with some spend on pizza singles) or move on to another hypothesis\n\nApproved\n\nFirst test charter: Brand 1\u2019s Walmart retail search test\n\n3\n\nNote: Walmart.com and the OPD are aggregated at the keyword level, therefore the test will be agnostic

of this work was to provide some preliminary observations, best practices, and industry examples on opportunities to strengthen audience planning and activation capability in Performance Marketing at CPG Co\nMore detailed investigation and codification of audience planning should be pilot-led as part of PMA/experimentation work\nAudience-led marketing planning has advanced in recent years as growing digital spend and more sophisticated tools enable better strategies\nAs part of the CPG Co Performance Marketing journey, the team has codified best practices and some improvements over current-state in a Performance Marketing playbook\nThis is a good first step (e.g., how to translate consumer targets to audiences) to build upon for Performance Marketing at scale\nIn the near-term, there are some key considerations for CPG Co to evolve its audience planning approach:\nStart with a broader consumer target segmentation (including sizing), across current core consumers, growth targets, and total addressable consumer base\nBuild more intelligent reach through in-platform micro audiences that aggregate to reach goals for macro cohorts/targets\nTest personalized creative with individual audiences to identify messages and content that resonate and drive performance\nPrioritize audiences that best deliver on marketing objectives based on performance \nIn the longer-term, there are some light-touch solutions to address CPG Co\u2019s longer horizon opportunity areas:\nMore consistent use of existing data and tools to enable use cases today\nMedia tagging for audience-level measurement/optimization; Consumer/Audience data for insights; MarTech tools: Salesforce CDP, SiteCore DAM, LiveRamp, etc.\nProcess and tools to embed and scale audience learnings, given consumer overlap across Brands\nCustomer collaboration to align on and implement high value retail media use cases\n\n3\n\n---\n\n## Slide 73\n\nAudience planning has gained sophistication in

consistent activation across platforms:\nCurrent process lacking exploration of a portfolio of audiences beyond a strategic muse with prioritized targets for maximized growth\nPerform audience sizing earlier to create opportunities for adjustment / budgeting\n\nIdentify audience builds early in the \u2018create\u2019 process with 1/2P data to drive better connection & relevant messaging: \nCurrent consumer target setting does not consistently leverage all relevant 1P/2P data as an input (e.g., purchasing behavior data)\nData sets are too narrow and/or refresh too infrequently to properly inform audiences\nInsights should drive towards meaningful problems to solve, tension points, etc. for a given audience\n\nRefresh ways of working for consistent and codified approach:\nLack of consistent audience activation processes with different resource models for different brands (e.g., dedicated CI partner)\nUnderutilization of available tools (e.g., SiteCore)\nLimited transparency into agency audience activation (i.e., who is included in the builds)\n\nUse captured and shared learnings to inform portfolio of audiences:\nNo mechanism for audience learnings to inform strategic targeting (e.g., which audiences performed the best)\nIRi audience builds do not auto refresh, causing lack of transparency to latest audience trends until audience are rebuilt\n\nCreate central tools for distinct audience development to minimize undesired overlap: \nAudiences are managed in separate tools; Retail media audiences are built in isolation\nAgency creates buyable audiences in isolation without transparency into ties to strategic plan\nLimited to no transparency into audience overlap (within and across brands) that creates inefficient targeting where unhealthy overlap exists\n\nCapture and share learnings to enable closed loops and cross-brand insights:\nAudiences are redeveloped every year with no library of best-performing audiences by platform/brand\nNo sharing of audience learnings across brands/BUs/OUs (i.e., what \u201cworked\u201d vs didn\u2019t)\nEfficiently target granular segments on retail media platforms\nPerform audience-level testing, measurement or optimization:\nLimited review of campaigns once launched\nReliance on agency and platform optimization\nUnderutilization of Salesforce reporting\n\nHowever, there are still opportunities for improvement in the current-state / playbook process\n\n3\n\nNote: CI \u2013 Customer Intelligence\n\n---\n\n## Slide 76\n\nIncrease / maintain buy rate\n\nIncrease penetration\n\nDrive awareness,
