<\q Explain incrementality testing reach campaigns vs conversion optimized campaigns/>

<\a Incrementality testing for reach campaigns versus conversion-optimized campaigns requires different approaches due to their distinct objectives:

For reach campaigns:
- Focus on measuring brand awareness lift rather than direct conversions
- Use surveys or brand lift studies to measure changes in awareness, consideration, and intent
- Compare test vs. control groups based on exposure to the campaign
- Longer measurement windows are often needed as impact develops gradually

For conversion-optimized campaigns:
- Measure direct impact on conversion metrics (purchases, sign-ups, etc.)
- Use randomized control trials with clearly defined test and control groups
- Implement proper exclusion mechanics to prevent audience overlap
- Compare conversion rates between exposed and unexposed audiences
- Shorter measurement windows typically suffice as impact is more immediate

Both require proper experimental design, adequate sample sizes, and statistical significance testing, but with different primary success metrics aligned to their specific objectives./>

<\q Multipliers are more or less the same for all channels. True or false./>

<\a False. Attribution multipliers vary significantly across different channels based on several factors:

1. Channel position in the funnel: Upper-funnel channels like display and social media typically have higher multipliers than lower-funnel channels like search, as platform-reporting tends to undercount their contribution.

2. Targeting approach: Prospecting campaigns often have higher multipliers than retargeting campaigns, as they initiate customer journeys that platform attribution fails to properly credit.

3. Media type: Video channels may have different multipliers than static display or text-based channels due to differences in engagement patterns and view-through attribution.

4. Device and cross-device journey: Mobile channels frequently have higher multipliers than desktop channels in many verticals due to cross-device conversion paths.

5. Industry vertical: Multipliers vary by industry based on typical purchase cycles and consumer behavior patterns.

Applying the same multiplier across all channels would lead to misallocation of credit and suboptimal budget decisions. Channel-specific multipliers based on incrementality testing or marketing mix modeling provide more accurate performance assessment./>

<\q Use the geo design template to show where to check if test is feasible and the simulated lift would pass MDL/>

<\a The geo design template helps determine test feasibility through several key checkpoints:

1. Geographic Unit Selection:
   - Verify sufficient number of non-overlapping geographic units (DMAs, zip codes, etc.)
   - Check if units can be properly randomized into test and control groups

2. Historical Data Analysis:
   - Analyze at least 8-12 weeks of historical conversion data by geographic unit
   - Calculate coefficient of variation (CV) across geo units to ensure it's below 0.5
   - Higher CV indicates more challenging test conditions requiring more geo units

3. Minimum Detectable Lift (MDL) Calculation:
   - Use the formula: MDL = 2.8 × CV × √(1/n_test + 1/n_control)
   - Where n_test and n_control are the number of geo units in each group
   - Lower MDL is better (typically aim for <15%)

4. Feasibility Assessment:
   - Compare your expected lift to calculated MDL
   - Expected lift must exceed MDL to be detectable (Expected Lift > MDL)
   - If MDL is too high, consider adding more geo units, longer test duration, or more granular geographic units

5. Power Analysis:
   - Calculate statistical power based on expected lift and MDL
   - Aim for at least 80% power to detect the expected lift

This systematic approach ensures you don't waste resources on tests that are unlikely to yield statistically significant results./>

<\q Explain simulating for incrementality/>

<\a Simulating for incrementality involves using statistical models to predict the causal impact of marketing interventions before actually running them. Here's how it works:

1. Data Collection: Gather historical data on:
   - Previous marketing activities across channels
   - Conversion metrics and business outcomes
   - External factors (seasonality, competitor actions, etc.)

2. Baseline Modeling: Establish what would happen without the intervention:
   - Create a predictive model using historical data
   - Account for time-series patterns, seasonality, and trends
   - Factor in external variables that influence outcomes

3. Treatment Effect Modeling: Estimate the causal effect:
   - Apply causal inference methodologies (synthetic control, difference-in-differences, etc.)
   - Use known parameters from previous incrementality tests
   - Apply appropriate statistical distributions to model uncertainty

4. Sensitivity Analysis: Test different scenarios:
   - Vary key assumptions about response rates and conversion patterns
   - Test different levels of marketing spending or allocation
   - Simulate different competitive environments

5. Confidence Intervals: Define the range of likely outcomes:
   - Calculate upper and lower bounds of expected lift
   - Estimate probability of exceeding minimum desired threshold
   - Account for statistical uncertainty in predictions

This approach allows marketers to assess the potential return on investment before committing resources, optimize test design parameters, and set realistic expectations for incrementality test outcomes./>

<\q Explain simulating for scale/>

<\a Simulating for scale involves using data models to predict how marketing performance changes as spending increases or decreases. This process helps identify optimal budget levels and anticipate diminishing returns. Here's the methodology:

1. Response Curve Modeling:
   - Plot historical spend levels against performance metrics
   - Fit mathematical models (logarithmic, polynomial, S-curve) to capture the relationship
   - Identify inflection points where efficiency changes significantly

2. Elasticity Calculation:
   - Determine spend elasticity (% change in outcome per % change in spend)
   - Calculate elasticity at different spending levels
   - Create segment-specific elasticity curves for more granular insights

3. Constraint Analysis:
   - Identify audience saturation points
   - Factor in platform-specific delivery limitations
   - Incorporate competitive share-of-voice considerations

4. Monte Carlo Simulations:
   - Run multiple simulations with varied parameters
   - Account for uncertainty in response rates
   - Generate probability distributions of expected outcomes

5. Scenario Planning:
   - Model different budget allocation scenarios
   - Predict performance at various total spending levels
   - Calculate expected ROAS or CPA at each level

6. Validation:
   - Test model predictions against small real-world spend increases
   - Calibrate models based on observed results
   - Continuously refine models with new data

This approach allows marketers to confidently answer questions about optimal spending levels, predict returns on increased investment, and avoid exceeding efficiency thresholds where additional spend yields diminishing returns./>

<\q What is multi-touch attribution?/>

<\a Multi-touch attribution is a method that allocates credit to multiple touchpoints along the customer journey. Instead of giving all credit to a single interaction (like the first or last touch), this approach recognizes that multiple channels and messages contribute to a conversion. Different multi-touch models include linear (equal credit to all touchpoints), time-decay (more credit to recent touches), U-shaped (more credit to first and last touches), and algorithmic (using machine learning to determine credit). This provides a more holistic view of marketing effectiveness across channels and campaigns./>

<\q What are 3 drawbacks of Multi-touch attribution?/>

<\a Three drawbacks of Multi-touch attribution include:

1. Complexity - Implementing MTA requires sophisticated tracking mechanisms and data integration, which can be technically challenging and resource-intensive for many organizations.

2. Data Limitations - Even the best MTA models struggle with cross-device tracking, offline interactions, and walled gardens (like social media platforms), leading to incomplete data and potential blind spots.

3. Interpretation Challenges - While MTA provides more data points than single-touch models, determining the right weighting or algorithm can be subjective, and results can be difficult to interpret without proper analytical context./>

<\q Are Google's attribution models better or more valuable in your experience than platforms like Facebook or TikTok and why?/>

<\a Google's attribution models aren't necessarily better or more valuable than those from platforms like Facebook or TikTok - each has inherent biases. Google's models tend to overvalue Google touchpoints, just as Facebook's models favor Facebook interactions. This happens because each platform can only track their own user journeys comprehensively. For truly valuable attribution insights, it's best to use independent, third-party attribution solutions that provide an unbiased, cross-platform
view of the customer journey rather than relying exclusively on any platform's self-attribution framework./>

<\q How does MTA account for offline channels including television and offline spend?/>

<\a Multi-touch attribution (MTA) accounts for offline channels like television and other offline spend through several approaches:

1. Time-based Correlation Analysis - Identifying spikes in digital activity (website visits, searches) that occur during or shortly after TV ad airings.

2. Geographic Testing - Comparing digital engagement in markets with TV/offline campaigns versus control markets without such campaigns.

3. Matched Market Testing - Using statistical methods to isolate the impact of TV ads by comparing similar markets with different levels of TV exposure.

4. Survey-Based Attribution - Asking customers how they heard about the brand/product to incorporate self-reported offline touchpoints.

5. Advanced Modeling - Using media mix modeling (MMM) alongside MTA to account for the impact of offline channels.

These methods help create a more comprehensive view of the customer journey across both online and offline touchpoints, though perfect attribution remains challenging./>

<\q Why is multi-touch attribution so hard to implement at scale?/>

<\a Multi-touch attribution is challenging to implement at scale for several key reasons:

1. Data Integration Complexity - Unifying data across disparate platforms (ad servers, CRM systems, websites, mobile apps) requires sophisticated technology infrastructure and data governance.

2. Technical Limitations - Cross-device tracking, privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA, and walled gardens (platforms like Facebook that limit data access) create significant blind spots in tracking the complete customer journey.

3. Organizational Alignment - Implementing MTA often requires cross-departmental collaboration and may challenge existing KPIs and budget allocations, creating organizational resistance.

These factors make truly comprehensive MTA implementations resource-intensive and technically challenging for many organizations./>

<\q How can you test for diminishing returns using incrementality tests?/>

<\a Testing for diminishing returns using incrementality tests involves a structured approach to identify the point at which additional marketing spend yields decreasing benefits:

1. **Tiered Exposure Tests:**
   - Create multiple test groups with increasing levels of advertising exposure
   - Maintain a control group with zero exposure
   - Compare incremental lift across different exposure levels
   - Identify when additional exposure produces less incremental value

2. **Spend Escalation Tests:**
   - Progressively increase spending in test markets while maintaining control markets
   - Measure incremental return at each spending level
   - Plot the marginal return on investment curve
   - Determine the inflection point where ROI begins to decline

3. **Frequency Cap Tests:**
